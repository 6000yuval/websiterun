Next.js MDX blog (minimal MVP)

This folder contains a minimal Next.js site that reads MDX files from content/articles and renders them with next-mdx-remote.

Drop your MDX files into content/articles and rebuild.

Deployment: connect to Vercel and set framework to Next.js. No env vars required for the static MVP.
